## the idea:
In this game the interface will display a board consisting of 25 blocks and the blocks contains random numbers, there is also a countdown timer and the count of remaining lives.

Player has to figure out and press the blocks in the correct order, before he ran out of time or lives, to win the game.

## how to play?
1- Press the visible number to start the game
2- Hover over the blocks to discover the numbers
3- Press the numbers in ascending order to win .. simple!
4- You should clear all blocks before you ran out of time or lives .. challenging :D
